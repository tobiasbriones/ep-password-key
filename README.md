# Example Project: Password Key

Example project for a program library that creates amateur encryption to save a
password into a file.

One must not implement own algorithms for security applications as well as data
structures as they are managed carefully by the corresponding community with the
proper expertise on the subject.

I got a problem back in time -when I wrote desktop apps- about saving a user's
login information in their computer. Saving sensitive information in plain text
is wrong, so I got an idea about making up my own algorithm, so this exercise
was fun because many years later I developed
[EP: Cryptosystems](https://github.com/tobiasbriones/ep-cryptosystems) which is
about actual (classic) cryptosystems, and they are similar to what I did much
before. I've never used this made-up password key algorithm for real
applications, obviously. Although it might look good, never use a non-standard
non-battle-tested security library.

## Encryption with Java

With this project you can learn how to use encryption in Java by using the 
package `javax.crypto` and the library `BCrypt`.

I still need to add test cases and one diagram I had made years ago I got to 
find among my notes.
